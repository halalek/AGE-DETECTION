# AGE DETECTION
Automatic age classification has become important and very relevant
Many existing applications, in particular
Social media applications, and for this reason several technologies have been developed
To reach satisfactory results, we discuss a method in this report
(CNN (based on data from IMFDB data-set))
Which is one of the (SET_DATA) methods that are calibrated
And the accuracy of its performance


## Dataset : Indian Movie Face database (IMFDB):
It is a large unbound base of 34512
   Portrait of 100) consisting of 67 male/33 female actors
There are at least 200 photos for each actor)
Faces collected from almost 100 videos
All images are hand selected and cropped from their clips
This video gave a high degree of contrast in terms of scope.
Person's posture, facial expressions, light, age, and
,, and make-up. Several pictures of actors were chosen
They have worked throughout the field so there is a variety of differences
The personal profile is the same and the database has been shortened
To search images.

## CNN:
The face detection task requires training neural networks
To be able to obtain the most important features in faces to be able to
  CNN is a differentiator, a convolutional neural network
It is the most popular method of image recognition, as it takes...
It takes the image as input, processes it, then passes it through its layers and classifies it
Computers take the image and treat it as a triangular matrix
Dimension of pixels
The size of this matrix depends on the image resolution
For example, if the size of the images is 3×6×6, these numbers express:
Next 6, 6 represents the length and width of the image and 3 indicates
RGB values of the image
